## ðŸ›  Installation
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
2. Click at your Tampermonkey extension icon, go to *Dashboard* -> *Utilities*, then at "_Import from URL_" you paste the url for raw version of index.js. (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nxve/AutoMudae/main/index.js)

## Usage
Open DiscordWeb, navigate to desired channel and refresh the page so Tampermonkey can inject the userscript at the tab.

Now you have two options at upper center of your Discord page:
- **Use Logged Users**: which uses all your Discord logged users (Up to 4)
- **Use Token List**: which will ask for a list of Discord tokens (Up to 20 for now)

You have now a **Run** button at upper right.
