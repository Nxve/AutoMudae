## ðŸ›  Installation
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
2. Go to [GreasyFork Script Page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/452710-automudae) and install it from there.

## Usage
Open Discord web, navigate to desired channel and refresh the page so Tampermonkey can inject the userscript at the tab.

Now you have two options at upper center of your Discord page:
- **Use Logged Users**: which uses all your Discord logged users (Up to 4)
- **Use Token List**: which will ask for a list of Discord tokens (Up to 20 for now)

You have now a **Run** button at upper right.

## TODO & Known Issues
- Add other language support
- Add config to delay claim (In case of $togglesnipe)
- Adapt to $togglebutton
- Add to total claimed kakera those received from EMERALD IV reward
- Add a way to list interesting characters/series to claim
- Improve it's performance while running on background (Chrome issue with "inactive" tabs)
